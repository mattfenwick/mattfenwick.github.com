# Notes on "General Systems Thinking" by Gerald Weinberg

## The problem

- The Law of Medium Numbers -- "for medium number systems, we can expect that large fluctuations, irregularities, and discrepancy with any theory will occur more or less regularly"
- large number systems can be described statistically
- medium number systems are hard to study and describe
- small number systems can be described analytically
- in machines created by humans, the hardest parts to build and the most fragile are the interfaces
- physics was successful because it did a great job of carefully limiting what it describes and where it's applied
- Newton's great accomplishment wasn't his laws of motion -- it was to figure out what could be ignored
- murphy's Law
- complexity
- mechanism, mechanics
- simplification

## The approach

- organism, analogy, and vitalism
- scientists and categories
- order of the 2nd degree is "the main article of general systems faith"
- law of the conservation of laws "when facts contradict the law, reject the facts or change the definitions, but never throw away the law"
- law of happy particularities: "any general law must have at least two specific applications"
- law of unhappy pecularities:
  - "any general law is bound to have at least two exceptions"
  - "if you never say anthing wrong, you never say anything"
- composition law: "the whole is more than the sum of its parts"
- decomposition law: "the part is more than a fraction of the whole"
- Models are for:
  - improving thought processes
  - studying special systems
  - creating new laws and refining old ones
- as we age, we train ourselves to focus on numbers and we miss the big picture

## System and Illusion

- "a system is a way of looking at the world"
- banana principle: "heuristic devices don't tell you when to stop applying them"
- absolute and relative thinking
- a system is relative to its observer
- observers and observations
- grownups ask about nonessentials like "how old is he?" instead of essentials like "what is the sound of his voice?"
- hypermathematisis: valid but useless mathematical theories
- principle of indifference: "laws should not depend on a particular choice of notation" (but often do)
- observer domination -- ability to distinguish everything that another observer sees
- systems as sets of objects and relations -- or not?

## Interpreting observations

- "a state: a situation which can be recognized if it occurs again"
- cycle
- "different observers see different things and place importance on different things"
- Eye-brain law:
  - "to a certain extent, mental power can compensate for observational weakness"
  - "to a certain extent, observational power can compensate for mental weakness"
- "knowing means knowing how to ignore certain details"
- generalized thermodynamic law: "more probable states are more likely to be observed than less probable states, unless specific constraints exist to keep them from occuring"
- "the things we see more frequently are more frequent because":
  1. there is a physical reason to favor certain states
  2. there is a mental reason to favor certain states
- lump law: "if we want to learn anything, we shouldn't try to learn everything"
- reductionism
- incompleteness
- overcompleteness
- the black box game
- "generalized law of complementarity: any two points of view are complementary"

## Breaking down observations

- principle of difference: "laws should not depend on a particular choice of symbols, but they usually do"
- axiom of experience: "the future should be like the past, because in the past, the future was like the past"
- metaphors of science
- we try to understand things in a complete, minimal, independent way
- boundaries and things
- qualities, principle of invariance:
  - "with respect to any given property, there are those transformations that preserve it and those that do not"
  - "with respect to a given transformation, there are those that are preserved by it and those that are not"
  - and thus => "we understand change only be observing what remains invariant, and permanence only by what is transformed"
- partitions
- perfect systems law: "true systems properties cannot be investigated"
- strong connection law: "systems, on the average, are more tightly connected than the average"
- "a system is a collection of parts, no one of which can be changed"
- "in systems, all other things are rarely equal"

## Describing behavior

- simulation: the white box
- "think in terms of doings/happenings rather than in terms of objects or static abstractions"
- state spaces
- "picture principle: when speaking about a dimensional reduction, insert the words 'a picture of' in whatever you were about to say"
- n-dimensional systems
- adding new dimensions to old observations doesn't invalidate them but rather augments them
- the dimensionality of observations can be reduced by projection
- diachronic principle: "if a line of behavior crosses itself, then either":
  - the system is not state determined
  - we are viewing a projection: an incomplete view
- synchronic principle: "if two systems occupy the same position in the state space at the same time, then the space is underdimensioned, that is, the view is incomplete"
- time as a standard of behavior
- "if you cannot think of three ways of abusing a tool, you do not understand how to use it"
- behavior in open systems
- open systems are hard to comprehend, but useful in practice. we often try to create (or think in terms of) closed systems
- "the principle of indeterminability: we cannot with certainty attribute observed constraint either to system or environment"

## Some systems questions

- systems triumvirate
  - "why do I see what I see?"
  - "why do things stay the same?"
  - "why do things change?"
- "stability: actually means change within certain limits"
- linear system: actually these do not exist, and are merely very narrowly and carefully defined limits of systems
- stable systems are easier to notice and to study ... that's why we think they're good (but that doesn't mean they're actually good)
- survival
- nature thinks of failure modes and how to protect against them, so that failures aren't lethal
- identity and difference, key problems are:
  - recognizing that two different things are different
  - recognizing that one thing changes over time, but remains the same thing
- identity is defined by the observer
- question of survival depends on:
  - what the environment does
  - how the system's program transforms the environment
  - what variables are involved in identity
  - how the observer's program operates on those variables
- regulation and adaptation
- law of effect:
  - "small changes in structure usually lead to small changes in behavior"
  - "small changes in the white box usually lead to small changes in the black box"
- we tend to see systems as composed of 2 things: a permanent part and a variable part ... but that's an arbitrary distinction
- no actual way to distinguish regulation from adaptation ... they're just tools of thought
- "used car law":
  - "a system doing a good job of regulation need not adapt"
  - "a system may adapt in order to simplify its job of regulation"
- here's another form of the used car law which emphasizes the observer:
  - "a way of looking at the world that isn't putting excessive stress on an observer need not be changed"
  - "a way of looking at the world may be changed to reduce the stress on an observer"
