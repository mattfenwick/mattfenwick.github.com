# Quick notes on "Accounting, A Very Short Introduction" by Christopher Nobes

 - most of the world uses either GAAP (U.S.) or IFRS
 
 - double-entry recording is very useful for keeping track of transactions
 
 - balance sheets are very useful for showing the current state of an enterprise
 
 - audits are performed to verify that financial reports present a fair view of an enterprise -- not to put together the financial reports themselves
