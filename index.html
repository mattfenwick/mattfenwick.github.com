What have I done?
<ul>
 <li>I previously worked on the <a href="http://connjur.uchc.edu/">Connjur</a> project,
     an open source effort dedicated to building software for 
     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMR">NMR</a> data analysis.
     Some of the problems I've worked on include:  building a GUI
     for the Connjur Spectrum Translator project, implementing a tool
     for analyzing schemes for more efficiently collecting NMR data, 
     building databases for storing and querying protein information,
     writing multiple parsers for converting between various NMR data formats,
     and solving protein structures using NMR.</li>
 <li>I've written my own library for quickly building parsers.  
     It works great, even for complicated languages!</li>
 <li>I've used my parser library to build a parser for the NMR-Star data format, which is used by
     the BMRB to archive NMR data.</li>
 <li>I defined and implemented my own programming language in order to learn about 
     concrete syntax, abstract syntax, and formal semantics.</li>
 <li>To hone my parsing skills and figure out some of the pitfalls, 
     I built parsers for regular expressions, the Clojure language, 
     the Java language, and the JSON format.</li>

A lot of my work has ended up in academic publications:
<ul>
 <li>Parser Combinators: A Practical Application for Generating Parsers for NMR Data.
     Fenwick et al, ITNG 2013</li>
 <li>Random phase detection in multidimensional NMR.  Maciejewski et al, PNAS 2011.</li>
 <li>An Open-Source Sandbox for Increasing the Accessibility of Functional 
     Programming to the Bioinformatics and Scientific Communities.  Fenwick et al, ITNG 2012.</li>
 <li>Error Reporting Parsers: a Monad Transformer Approach.
